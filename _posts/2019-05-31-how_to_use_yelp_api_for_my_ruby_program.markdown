I never heard of API until recently when I work on my CLI program. Actually, what I am trying to do through the program is to get information to help myself and my other parent friends to find the best day care center in the neighborhood. Without too many thinking, I decide to use Yelp to look for information since it has a lot of users around America and even the whole world and therefore, should provide more opinions with great variety. 

At first, I got information from Yelp by scraping from the website. "Why don't you use API?" However, after I talked to my tutor Beth, she asked me that and I decided to challenge myself and use API even I never heard of it before she metioned that. While to a lot of great developers out there, API may be very easy things, but to me, it took me a long time to finally get to understand a bit of its concept and usage.  So here, I am not trying to make a tutorial talk about API, but actually just trying to write down what I know or understand about API, like making notes for the future me. The rest of the article talks about just my basic understanding of API after I have done some research. Therefore, they might not be super accurate. Please e-mail me when you find something wrong, thanks!

1. My understanding: what is API?
Literally, API means Application Programming Interface. But I don't really know what that means exactly. After I have been doing some research, I got this impression that, API is a way for a software to communicate with another, or to many other softwares.  Usually when we, as human being users, surf the Internet using web browser, we send a request and get some vivid images or attractive layout more than just plain text information we want. In the API case, since it is software to software, compelling presentation is not necessary, so it will respond with only the "meat", the information we want. The format it has is usually very simple and easy to utilize. 

I will keep updating my understanding about API here!
